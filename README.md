# team-profile-generator

This is a Team Profile Generator which you use directly from the terminal, and allows you to create a html page with the information you have entered. This application uses inquirer, and jest to test code before it is written out. The application also uses JQUERY and bootstrap for the html page. This program also uses object oriented programming and test driven development. 

Here is an image of what the html output should look like

In this <a href = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Z7vMwAX7PXI5sUPLFpEMiscPyJBMSPu/view?usp=sharing'> Google Drive</a> is the tutorial on how to use the application. 

When starting the application you will be asked questions about the manager like office number, name, id, and email. Then you will be asked about your team where you can choose between intern or engineer. Based on what you pick you will be prompted to answer a github username if they are a engineer or a school if they are a intern. Regardless of what you pick you will always need to enter a name, id, and email, and all this will be stored into an array called employees. Then you will be asked if you want to enter another team member, if you say yes, then you repeat the process. Once you say no, the application will generate a html page with the inforamtion entered and it will be styled into cards, with all the links active. The application will also display a message on where to find the html file, incase you are lost.
